#### Description:

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as passenger class, age, gender, and fare. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) uncovers patterns and insights about survival rates. Missing data is handled through imputation, and feature engineering is performed to create new variables. The model's goal is to accurately classify passengers into survivors or non-survivors.
